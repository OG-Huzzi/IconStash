## Performance Architecture

- **Pre-rendered HTML grid** — First paint shows icons instantly with no JavaScript data loading
- **Lazy background sync** — Library JSON data (150MB+) only starts downloading when the user interacts with search or filters
- **Virtual scroll** — Search results use a virtualized DOM grid to prevent memory bloat with 100k+ results
- **Chunked prerender** — Each library's icon grid is split into HTML chunks fetched progressively on scroll
- **Service Worker caching** — Prerender chunks are cached for instant subsequent loads
